# Insagram x Film Photos

## Why?
I have way too many film photos that I have never posted, I want to show them off on Instagram but don't really feel like manually doing it so... let's use [instagrapi](https://subzeroid.github.io/instagrapi/)

## How it works
It's just a Flask server, takes in any number of pictures and you choose a date and time to start posting them to your story. It will post them with 30 min in between each picture and that's kind of it really. Not much to it

## Don't flame me for the UI
